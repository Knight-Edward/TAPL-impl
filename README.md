# Notice.
This are the implementations for type-checkers from the wonderful "Types and Programming Languages" book from Benjamin Pierce.

They are also available here, but as a series of tar files, so I made this repository out of convenience for other students:

# Update.
update with the latest ocamlc for arith.

## TODO
Fix other chapters. I guess most of them are having the similar problems like outdated APIs.
Also, I may add some commnets of the code or notes of study.
